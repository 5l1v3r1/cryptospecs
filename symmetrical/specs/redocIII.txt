REDOC III

REDOC III is a streamlined version of REDOC II, also designed by Michael Wood [1615]. It operates
on an 80-bit block. The key length is variable and can be as large as 2560 bytes (20, 480 bits).
The algorithm consists solely of XORing key bytes with message bytes; there are no permutations or
substitutions.
(1)  Create a key table of 256 10-byte keys, using the secret key.
(2)  Create two 10-byte mask blocks, M1 and M2. M1 is the XOR of the first 128 10-byte keys; M2 is
the XOR of the second 128 10-byte keys.
(3)  To encrypt a 10-byte block:
(a)  XOR the first byte of the data block with the first byte of M1. Select a key from the key
table computed in step (1). Use the computed XOR as the index into the table. XOR each byte in the
data block with the corresponding byte in the chosen key, except for the first data byte.
(b)  XOR the second byte of the data block with the second byte of M1. Select a key from the key
table computed in step (1). Use the computed XOR as the index into the table. XOR each byte in the
data block with the corresponding byte in the chosen key, except for the second data byte.
(c)  Continue with the entire block (bytes 3 through 10), until each byte has been used to select a
key from the key table after XORing it with the corresponding M1 value. Then XOR each byte with the
key except for the byte used to select the key.
(d)  Repeat steps (a) through (c) with M2.

The algorithm is easy and fast. On a 33 megahertz 80386, the algorithm encrypts data at 2.75
megabits per second. Wood estimates that a VLSI-pipelined design, with a 64-bit data path, woud
encrypt data at over 1.28 gigabits per second with a 20 megahertz clock.

REDOC III is not secure [1440]. It is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis. Only about 223
chosen plaintexts are required to reconstruct both masks.
